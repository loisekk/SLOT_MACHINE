# 🎰 Slot Machine Game (Python)

A **casino-style Slot Machine game** built using Python that runs entirely in the terminal. The project simulates real-world slot machine mechanics including deposits, multi-line betting, random spins, and payout calculations.

Designed with **clean logic, modular functions, and strong input validation**, this project demonstrates practical Python fundamentals and game-based problem solving.

---

## ✨ Features

* 💰 Secure deposit & balance tracking
* 🎯 Bet on multiple lines (1–3)
* 🔁 Randomized 3×3 slot machine spins
* 🧮 Per-line winnings calculation
* 🛑 Prevents over-betting beyond balance
* 🖥 Simple & readable terminal UI
* ✅ Robust input validation

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3
* **Modules:** `random`
* **Concepts Used:**

  * Functions & loops
  * Dictionaries & lists
  * Control flow & conditionals
  * Randomization logic
  * Modular programming

---

## ⚙️ Game Flow

1. Deposit an initial balance
2. Choose number of betting lines (1–3)
3. Place a bet per line
4. Spin the slot machine
5. Symbols are randomly generated per column
6. Matching symbols across a line generate winnings
7. Balance updates after each spin

---

## 🎰 Symbols & Payout Rules

| Symbol | Frequency | Payout Multiplier |
| ------ | --------- | ----------------- |
| A      | Very Low  | 5×                |
| B      | Low       | 4×                |
| C      | Medium    | 3×                |
| D      | High      | 2×                |

> Higher-value symbols appear less frequently to maintain game balance.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python slot_machine.py
```

### Requirements

* Python 3.x installed

---

## 📂 Project Structure

```
slot_machine.py   # Main game logic
```

---

## 🧠 Implementation Highlights

* Column-based symbol generation ensures **realistic randomness**
* Symbols are removed per column to avoid duplicates
* Winnings calculated **per winning line**, not total bet
* Clean separation of concerns using helper functions
* Easy to extend or refactor
